# EH_245_Project

Plan:

1. Decide what data to use - Armelle figure out what's going on, make joint decision
2. Evaluate and present the correlation structure of the exposure matrix. Do you see any clear pattern emerging? - Armelle
4. Conduct a multiple regression analysis. Is there any evidence of multicollinearity?
5. Evaluate the association between the mixture and the outcome using at least 2 of
the following 3 approaches: weighted quantile sum regression, Lasso/ridge/elastic net,
Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression. For each method, report analysis description
and results as you would do in a scientific paper. - Becca BMKR, Armelle something else

- Briefly discuss the assumptions of each method you use
- Be concise
- Limit your total number of tables/figures to max 5
- Present both adjusted and unadjusted results

5. Compare results between the different approaches - Becca
6. Discuss the results - Armelle
